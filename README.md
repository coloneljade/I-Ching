# I-Ching
A Simple I Ching hexagram generator in Python 3 for those who want to expedite the process.

The object file has the hexagram object needed for main, main is just a very simple interactive program. The probabilities for this match up with those for the favored "yarrow sticks method" for consulting the I Ching, so those looking for authenticity should use this.

Stretch goals for the future are to add an option so you can also do the 3-coins method, but only if I get extra-motivated.
